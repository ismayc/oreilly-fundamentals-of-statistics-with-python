## Answer to Question 35

**Given a dataset with values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, what is the standard deviation approximately?**

- **A)** 1  
- <span style="color:green;">**B)** 14.14 ✅</span>  
- **C)** 30  
- **D)** 100  
- **E)** 200  

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** The standard deviation for the dataset {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} is approximately 14.14, since the standard deviation is a measure of the “average deviation” a point is from its mean.

## Question 36

**If the mean of a dataset is 50 and the standard deviation is 5, what is the value that is one standard deviation above the mean?**

- **A)** 45  
- **B)** 50  
- **C)** 55  
- **D)** 60  
- **E)** 65

- **A)** 45  
- **B)** 50  
- <span style="color:green;">**C)** 55 ✅</span>  
- **D)** 60  
- **E)** 65  

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** One standard deviation above the mean is calculated as mean + standard deviation, which in this case is 50 + 5 = 55.

- **B)** Median  
- <span style="color:green;">**C)** Mode ✅</span>  
- **D)** Standard deviation  
- **E)** Variance  

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** The mode is the most appropriate measure of central tendency for categorical data, as it identifies the most frequently occurring category.

- **A)** 7  
- **B)** 8  
- **C)** 9  
- **D)** 10  
- **E)** 11

- **A)** 7  
- **B)** 8  
- <span style="color:green;">**C)** 9 ✅</span>  
- **D)** 10  
- **E)** 11  

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. In the dataset {7, 8, 9, 10, 11}, the median is 9.

## Question 39

**What does a high standard deviation indicate about a dataset?**

- **A)** The data points are very close to the mean  
- **B)** The data points are spread out over a large range of values  
- **C)** The data points are all identical  
- **D)** The mean is equal to the median  
- **E)** The data has a high number of outliers

- **A)** The data points are very close to the mean  
- <span style="color:green;">**B)** The data points are spread out over a large range of values ✅</span>  
- **C)** The data points are all identical  
- **D)** The mean is equal to the median  
- **E)** The data has a high number of outliers  

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values, showing high variability.

## Question 40

**If a dataset has a mean of 100 and a median of 80, what can be inferred about the skewness of the dataset?**

- **A)** The dataset is symmetric  
- **B)** The dataset is positively skewed  
- **C)** The dataset is negatively skewed  
- **D)** The dataset has no skewness  
- **E)** The dataset is normally distributed

## Answer to Question 40

**If a dataset has a mean of 100 and a median of 80, what can be inferred about the skewness of the dataset?**

- **A)** The dataset is symmetric  
- <span style="color:green;">**B)** The dataset is positively skewed ✅</span>  
- **C)** The dataset is negatively skewed  
- **D)** The dataset has no skewness  
- **E)** The dataset is normally distributed  

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** If the mean is higher than the median, the dataset is likely positively skewed, meaning that there are some higher values pulling the mean upwards.
